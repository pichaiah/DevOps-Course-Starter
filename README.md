# DevOps Apprenticeship: Project Exercise

## Getting started

The project uses a virtual environment to isolate package dependencies. To create the virtual environment and install required packages, run the following from a bash shell terminal:

### On macOS and Linux
```bash
$ source setup.sh
```
### On Windows (Using Git Bash)
```bash
$ source setup.sh --windows
```
Setup the below Environment variables for Trello API
```
TRELLO_KEY
TRELLO_TOKEN
TRELLO_BOARD_ID
TRELLO_TODO_LIST_ID
TRELLO_DOING_LIST_ID
TRELLO_DONE_LIST_ID
```

Install geckodriver and Firefox as we need these two for running selenium tests.

Once the setup script has completed and all packages have been installed, start the Flask app by running:
```bash
$ flask run
```

You should see output similar to the following:
```bash
 * Serving Flask app "app" (lazy loading)
 * Environment: development
 * Debug mode: on
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
 * Restarting with fsevents reloader
 * Debugger is active!
 * Debugger PIN: 226-556-590
```
Now visit [`http://localhost:5000/`](http://localhost:5000/) in your web browser to view the app.
